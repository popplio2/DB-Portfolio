        <p>
          For summer 2024, I was accepted to the Global Mitigation Project's
          <a
            href="https://www.globalwarmingmitigationproject.org/constellations"
            target="_blank"
            >Constellations Fellowship </a
          >, under which I completed a Web Developer Internship at
          SubjectToClimate. My main contribution was creating the Climate Change
          Explainers page linked above.
        </p>
        <p>
          This involved close collaboration with the design team, marketing, and
          other developers to ensure the project met its goals. I also had to
          quickly learn new programming languages, libraries, and APIs, which
          sharpened my problem-solving skills and increased my ability to work
          independently. Working remotely also improved my communication skills,
          particularly in presenting my progress to leadership and knowing when
          to ask key questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, at the end of my fellowship, I presented my
          accomplishments to the leadership of the Constellations Fellowship!
          The presentation is included below.
